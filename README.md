rc
==============

My work environment: vim, bash, git configs

## Installation

1. make sure any user/machine specific things in ~/.bashrc are moved to ~/.bash_variables
2. `cd rc`
3. `make install`
4. `wget https://raw.github.com/git/git/master/contrib/completion/git-completion.bash -O ~/.git-completion.bash`
